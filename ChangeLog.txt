1.0.2

- Fix sound issue using the patch sent by original X-roar's author, 
  aka Ciaran himself (big thanks to him !!)
- Bug fix with volume settings (it didn't work properly)
- A thumbnail image is now displayed in the file requester 
  while selecting any file with the same name of a previously 
  saved game (rom, keyboard, settings).
  It might be very helpful to recognize that game later if you 
  have thousand different games on your disk and rom folders !
- The virtual keyboard is now usable in the file requester menu to
  choose the first letter of the game you search !
